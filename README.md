# VulSenseWebApp
An implementation of VulnSense-smart contract vulnerability detection framework (source code &amp; demo)


A multimodal deep learning framework for efficient smart contract vulnerability detection. VulnSense analyzes both the source code and documentation of Ethereum smart contracts. It uses BERT and Bi-LSTM models to extract features from both the code and text. These features are then fed into a fully connected layer to predict vulnerabilities. Compared to prior single-model approaches, VulnSense leverages a multimodal architecture to achieve superior detection accuracy.
